# software_engineering - Business Management Application

Project is for building a customizable interface for business applications

Using the template code, the business manager can add data for finances, account/customer management, employee management, and keeping track of business/operations.  The user will be able to create custom names of elements for each of the business functions, as our application will ultimately be written as a business application for writing business applications.  We will have an indexing system for performing the proper CRUD operations, and plan to use SQLite or MySQL

Project is an ongoing event during Spring 2016 for CPS 410 at CMU.
